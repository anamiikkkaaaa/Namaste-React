what is a hook in react?
A normal js function, has it its own use case

---->
as soon as our website loads, our component gets rendered and then useEffect is called.
console.log in our component will log before 
console log inside useEffect

can we not fetch swiggy's data from swiggy api
what or cors policy?
our browser block api call from one origin to another
localhost to swiggy on chrome
we can download cors extension in chrome to allow
cross origin calls

wihtout useState our js variable will update if we
try to but it will not re-render it in our UI

whenever the state changes, component re-renders

whenever state variables update, react triggers
a reconciliation cycle(re-renders the component)

react is finding the difference between the older
virtual dom and newer virtual dom
